* [General Documenting](#general-documenting)

## General Documenting
* The preferred way of documenting things (except [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) for C/C++) is Markdown.

## If you have any doubts or comments
Please read the [Asking Questions](asking-questions.md) section, and once you've succeded with its [self-evaluation](asking-questions.md#self-evaluation-time) follow the recommendations by commenting publicly [HERE](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/developer-manual/issues/new) if required
