# Asking Questions

* **If you have a question, do a search first on our **[**wiki**](http://robots.uc3m.es/)** and among open and closed issues of the repository associated to your project**. In case you don't find the right answer, **open an issue in said repository (or at [QA](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/questions-and-answers) if it extremely generic) or add a comment in the **_**Discussion**_** tab on the wiki**:
  * Increased global productivity as logs are kept. It tends to avoid repetition of the same questions and the same answers.
  * A convenient tool to keep any technical topic inside its technical context and focus on the proper issue's subject.
  * Higher visibility of your topic in such a way that the answer may come from unexpected people. This is especially interesting in cases of disagreement between two parties where unrelated contributors may bring up new ideas and worthy viewpoints.
* Attempting to unify labels for questions in GitHub, [teo-main](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-main/labels) for inspiration.
