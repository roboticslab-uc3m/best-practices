# Asking Questions

## What should I do before asking a question?
The quickest answers are the ones that are already written! It's pretty possible that your question has already been answered somewhere!!

Here are some places where to look before asking a question:
* Read the manuals! You can find a list of all the manuals including this one [HERE](appendix/repository-index.md#manuals-and-faqs)
* Do a search among open and closed issues of the repository associated to your project.
* We still have some information in our [old wiki](http://robots.uc3m.es/)

## I cannot find my question answered anywhere, how and where should I ask my question?
Please open a GitHub Issue following [THESE GUIDELINES](best-practices-github.md#github-issues).

Ideally, you'd open the GitHub Issue in one of the following repositories:
* If it is clearly specific to one repository, open an issue on that repository. Examples: [yarp-devices](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/yarp-devices/issues), [kinematics-dynamics](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/kinematics-dynamics/issues), [vision](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/vision/issues)...
* If it is extremely generic but refers to a specific robot, go to the robot's main repository. Examples: [teo-main](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-main/issues), [asibot-main](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/asibot-main/issues)...
   * Note that TEO has its own private [teo-hardware-issues](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-hardware-issues/issues) repository where you can also open an issue on any specific TEO hardware issue.
* If it extremely generic, open an issue at: [questions-and-answers](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/questions-and-answers)
* If it refers to a wiki page, add a comment in the *Discussion* tab on the wiki.

## I really don't like GitHub Issues, why can't I just bug somebody who knows the answer?
There are several reasons to prefer GitHub Issues rather than asking in person or private messaging:
* Answers are left for future people with doubts, and even the *you from the future* can run into the same issue after some time and then find the solution online!
* Developers can have more time to perform research and/or create new cool applications, maybe even that coffee-making or pizza-delivery robot you've been waiting for, yay!
* GitHub Issues have proved many times to be an efficient mechanism to receive answers from very unexpected contributors, which have provided many answers, new ideas, and worthy viewpoints!!

## Self evaluation time!
