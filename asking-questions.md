# Asking Questions

## What should I do before asking a question?
The quickest answers are the ones that are already written, and it's pretty possible that your question has already been answered somewhere!

Here are some places to look for information before asking a question:
* Read the manuals! You can find a list of all the manuals including this one [HERE](appendix/repository-index.md#manuals-and-faqs)
* Do a search first on our and among open and closed issues of the repository associated to your project.
* We still have some information in our [old wiki](http://robots.uc3m.es/)

## I cannot find my question answered anywhere, where and how should I ask my question?

Please open a GitHub Issue in one of the following repositories:
* If it is clearly specific to one repository, open an issue on that repository. Examples: [yarp-devices](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/yarp-devices/issues), [kinematics-dynamics](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/kinematics-dynamics/issues), [vision](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/vision/issues)...
* If it is extremely generic but refers to a specific robot, go to the robot's main repository. Examples: [teo-main](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-main/issues), [asibot-main](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/asibot-main/issues)...
   * Note that TEO has its own private [teo-hardware-issues](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-hardware-issues/issues) repository where you can also open an issue on any specific TEO hardware issue.
* If it extremely generic, open an issue at: [questions-and-answers](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/questions-and-answers)
* If it refers to a wiki page, add a comment in the *Discussion* tab on the wiki.
