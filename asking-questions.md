# Asking Questions

**If you have a question, do a search first on our **[**wiki**](http://robots.uc3m.es/)** and among open and closed issues of the repository associated to your project**.

In case you don't find the right answer, **open an issue in one of the following repositories**:
* If it is clearly specific to one repository, open an issue on that repository. Examples: [yarp-devices](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/yarp-devices/issues), [kinematics-dynamics](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/kinematics-dynamics/issues), [vision](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/vision/issues)...
* If it is extremely generic but refers to a specific robot, go to the robot's main repository. Examples: [teo-main](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-main/issues), [asibot-main](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/asibot-main/issues)...
   * Note that TEO has its own private [teo-hardware-issues](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-hardware-issues/issues) repository where you can also open an issue on any specific TEO hardware issue.
* If it extremely generic, open an issue at: [questions-and-answers](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/questions-and-answers)
* If it refers to a wiki page, add a comment in the *Discussion* tab on the wiki.

Regarding which `label` to assign to an issue in GitHub, we are attempting to unify them, with [teo-main](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-main/labels) for inspiration.

Reasons for using GitHub issues rather than private messaging:
* Increased global productivity as logs are kept. It tends to avoid repetition of the same questions and the same answers.
* A convenient tool to keep any technical topic inside its technical context and focus on the proper issue's subject.
* Higher visibility of your topic in such a way that the answer may come from unexpected people. This is especially interesting in cases of disagreement between two parties where unrelated contributors may bring up new ideas and worthy viewpoints.
