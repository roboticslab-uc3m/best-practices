# Main Developer Tools

- Operating System (OS): [Tutorial (Spanish)](https://asrob-uc3m.gitbooks.io/tutoriales/content/software/linux/introduction.html)
   - For desktops and laptops, we mainly recommend the Desktop version of Ubuntu, and are currently in the transition between `16.04` and `18.04`. Both are good options as they are Long-term support (LTS). Ubuntu ISO installers can be downloaded from <https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop>
   - For robots, see [roboticslab-uc3m/questions-and-answers#20](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/questions-and-answers/issues/20). 
- Bash: [Tutorial (Spanish)](https://asrob-uc3m.gitbooks.io/tutoriales/content/software/linux/bash.html) 
- C/C++: Low-level (control) programming. Some good slides on C are "Thinking in C" by Bruce Eckel, and some good books on C++ are "Thinking in C++" by Bruce Eckel. A nice IDE is QTCreator, but you can also customize Eclipse, Atom or even Vim. 
- CMake: [Tutorial (Spanish)](https://asrob-uc3m.gitbooks.io/tutoriales/content/software/programming/cmake.html)
- Version control: [Tutorial (Spanish)](https://asrob-uc3m.gitbooks.io/tutoriales/content/software/version-control/git.html) / [Usage within roboticslab-uc3m organization](version-control.md)
- Markdown: [Tutorial (Spanish)](https://asrob-uc3m.gitbooks.io/tutoriales/content/writing/markdown.html)
- Python: High-level (algorithm) programming.
- Doxygen: Document code, within the code.
