# Main Developer Tools

## Which Operating System should I use?
- For desktops and laptops, we recommend Ubuntu (Desktop version) on a native partition. You are free to choose between versions `16.04` and `18.04`. Either one is a good option, although we have slight more support for `16.04`. For further information, please read: [Linux - Introducción (Spanish)](https://asrob-uc3m.gitbooks.io/tutoriales/content/software/linux/introduction.html)
- For robot on-board CPUs, you can read through a long conversation at: [questions-and-answers#20](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/questions-and-answers/issues/20). 

## I was told to install something. How can I do that?
- Please make sure you carefully read and understood the dedicated section at: [Linux - Introducción (Spanish)](https://asrob-uc3m.gitbooks.io/tutoriales/content/software/linux/introduction.html#¿cómo-instalo-programas-en-linux)
- Each of our repositories usually contains instructions for installing, e.g. the initial `README.md` of <https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/vision> links to its [doc/vision-install.md](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/vision/blob/develop/doc/vision-install.md) documentation file.
   - Note 1: Don't know what a repository is? Please read [Control de versiones (Spanish)](https://asrob-uc3m.gitbooks.io/tutoriales/content/software/version-control/index.html)
   - Note 2: This manual contains an index of our repositories: [HERE](repository-index.md)
- For instructions on installing 3rd party software, please see a special repository we maintain: https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/installation-guides

## I see a lot of commands for installation but do not understand anything. What do they mean?
- Please read: [Linux - Bash (Spanish)](https://asrob-uc3m.gitbooks.io/tutoriales/content/software/linux/bash.html)

## I've heard lots of stuff about Git and GitHub. What do they mean?
- Please read:
   - [Git y GitHub (Spanish)](https://david-estevez.gitbooks.io/the-git-the-bad-and-the-ugly/content/es/control-de-versiones.html)
   - [Control de versiones - Git (Spanish)](https://asrob-uc3m.gitbooks.io/tutoriales/content/software/version-control/git.html)

## Programming Stuff
- C/C++: Low-level (control) programming. Some good slides on C are "Thinking in C" by Bruce Eckel, and some good books on C++ are "Thinking in C++" by Bruce Eckel. A nice IDE is QTCreator, but you can also customize Eclipse, Atom or even Vim. 
- CMake: [Tutorial (Spanish)](https://asrob-uc3m.gitbooks.io/tutoriales/content/software/programming/cmake.html)
- Python: High-level (algorithm) programming.
- Doxygen: Document code, within the code.

## Even More Stuff
- Markdown: [Tutorial (Spanish)](https://asrob-uc3m.gitbooks.io/tutoriales/content/writing/markdown.html)
