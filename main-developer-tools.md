   - Virtual machine: Less risky as boot and partitions are not touched. However, issues with: enabling virtualization in BIOS, connecting devices such as USB webcam, and additionally difficult configuration for networking beyond NAT (bridge adaptors, windows firewalls, etc).
   - Partition: More risky as boot and partitions are touched.
